## Operating System Read() &amp; Write() command with time complexity function 
### Overview
The execution of the read and write code made us know about the operation of the OS. So, In conclusion we can see through the plotting of graph made us to note the optimum level of usage between the memory register and processor. OS makes the usage of hardware so efficient and time saving.
### Code Explanation
Now looking into the code we can the working of the write and read functions works on the language platform and where OS fetches the data and convert to assembly language and then convert it to binary codes to interact with the machines.
 
### Graph Plotting
In the graph we can see once the compilers compile the code the results displayed in the order for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 & 1024 bytes. For the file sizes 1MB to 128MB.
Each line describe each file size from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 &128 MB .
#### Observation from the graph
We can observe that OS takes more time to do the job compared to other precedence job the graph line is Inverted “L” shape accordance with time taken where it is nearly “0.0003”.
